# VidEdit: third-party software

VidEdit includes the following open source software. Their licences are reproduced below; the
complete text of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 is in the file
COPYING.LGPLv2.1 shipped next to this one (VidEdit.app/Contents/Resources).

## FFmpeg 7.1.5 (libavformat, libavcodec, libavutil, libswresample, libswscale)

FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later
(LGPL-2.1-or-later). VidEdit uses FFmpeg built with `--disable-gpl --disable-nonfree`, so no
GPL or non-free component is included. The FFmpeg libraries are dynamically linked and shipped
as separate, unmodified shared libraries in VidEdit.app/Contents/Frameworks (libavformat.61.dylib,
libavcodec.61.dylib, libavutil.59.dylib, libswresample.5.dylib, libswscale.8.dylib), loaded
through @rpath: you may replace them with your own build of the same FFmpeg major versions
(re-sign the application bundle afterwards, for example with `codesign --force --deep --sign -`).

Source code: the libraries are built from the unmodified release tarball
https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-7.1.5.tar.xz (SHA-256
de668509caf9e35e3cd162473441fdb29538c6d96ed080292b3cf9e6fc5d558f) by the script
Scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh in the VidEdit source repository, which records the exact configure
options. On request, the author will provide the complete corresponding source code of the
FFmpeg libraries shipped with any VidEdit release (including the build script), for at least
three years after that release, at no charge beyond the cost of distribution.

FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard, originator of the FFmpeg project.

**Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0**

 1. **License Terms.**

    **Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
     Licensor, on behalf of itself and successors in interest and assigns,
     grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
     no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this
     License) patent license to its Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, offer
     for sale, import or distribute any Implementation.

     **Conditions.**

    *Availability.* As a condition to the grant of rights to Licensee to make,
       sell, offer for sale, import or distribute an Implementation under
       Section 1.1, Licensee must make its Necessary Claims available under
       this License, and must reproduce this License with any Implementation
       as follows:

          a. For distribution in source code, by including this License in the
          root directory of the source code with its Implementation.

          b. For distribution in any other form (including binary, object form,
          and/or hardware description code (e.g., HDL, RTL, Gate Level Netlist,
          GDSII, etc.)), by including this License in the documentation, legal
          notices, and/or other written materials provided with the
          Implementation.

    *Additional Conditions.* This license is directly from Licensor to
       Licensee.  Licensee acknowledges as a condition of benefiting from it
       that no rights from Licensor are received from suppliers, distributors,
       or otherwise in connection with this License.

    **Defensive Termination**. If any Licensee, its Affiliates, or its agents
     initiates patent litigation or files, maintains, or voluntarily
     participates in a lawsuit against another entity or any person asserting
     that any Implementation infringes Necessary Claims, any patent licenses
     granted under this License directly to the Licensee are immediately
     terminated as of the date of the initiation of action unless 1) that suit
     was in response to a corresponding suit regarding an Implementation first
     brought against an initiating entity, or 2) that suit was brought to
     enforce the terms of this License (including intervention in a third-party
     action by a Licensee).

    **Disclaimers.** The Reference Implementation and Specification are provided
     "AS IS" and without warranty. The entire risk as to implementing or
     otherwise using the Reference Implementation or Specification is assumed
     by the implementer and user. Licensor expressly disclaims any warranties
     (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of
     merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or
     title, related to the material. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
     ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF
     ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH
