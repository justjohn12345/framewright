# Integration notes for the next round (from the 2026-09-23 fix round)

State after the fix round for `2026-09-23-full-review.md`: full Framewright scheme green with
`-Wall -Wextra` and warnings as errors (C/ObjC/C++ and Swift); Audio, Playback, Facade, DecodePool
and FrameCache suites clean under ThreadSanitizer. Unfixed items are in `open-findings.md`; this
file lists what later phases (6: transitions/effects UI, 7: export, 8: persistence) must adopt.

## Edits and gestures (phase 6 inspector, transition handles)
- Every continuous gesture: `beginCoalescingWithKey:`, then make each of its edits inside
  `performInCoalescingGroup(key) { ... }`, then `endCoalescing` / `cancelCoalescing`. An edit
  made outside the block while the group is open ends the group first (the gesture becomes its
  own undo step) and the gesture's later steps return `VEEditErrorBusy`: handle that (stop
  issuing steps). `removeAsset:` is still refused with Busy while a group is open.
- App side: `ProjectStore.isGestureActive` (timeline drag or an open engine group) guards every
  edit command reachable from keys and menus; add the guard to new edit commands (transition
  duration, fades, effect presets...). The inspector's sliders keep their group key in `@State`
  and end the group in `onDisappear`; copy that pattern for new sliders/handles.
- `MoveClips` re-homes a transition whose two clips land on the same track; a move that breaks
  the cut still drops it (reported in `droppedTransitionIDs`).
- `FreshIds` forwards `mergeWith`, so `CoalesceMode::Accumulate` works through the facade (e.g.
  repeated nudges or an effect parameter scrubbed by keys).

## Media identity (any code that decodes or caches by asset id)
- Asset ids restart per project. `FrameCache` has media epochs (`beginEpoch()`, `put(epoch, ...)`
  refuses older epochs); `DecodePool::beginEpoch(epoch)` forgets assets, targets, scrub requests
  and decoders; `PlaybackController::forgetMedia()` forgets registrations and routing. The facade
  does all three in `forgetProjectMedia` (New/Open). An `ExportJob` (phase 7) that owns a pool on
  the shared cache must register its assets itself and tag its puts with the current epoch.
- Several pools share the cache: each has its own `FrameCache` focus client (merged for
  eviction) and its own `Config::budgetFraction` (program 0.5, source 0.25). Give an export pool
  its own share (the shares should add up to at most 1).
- A decoded frame is published only if its stream still exists and its asset slot was not
  replaced (relink, invalidate, epoch): after those calls return nothing older reaches the cache.
  `waitUntilIdle` now also waits for steps of removed streams and for scrub decoder cleanup.
- `PlaybackController::setSequence` drops the pictures a frame source holds (clip ids repeat
  across projects); `modelChanged` keeps them.

## Playback and monitors
- One monitor plays at a time: starting the program pauses the source monitor and vice versa
  (in the facade).
- `modelChanged` posts a status when the clamp moves a stopped/scrubbing playhead (UI playheads
  follow edits that shorten the sequence).
- `VEPlaybackStats` has `presentedFrameIndex`, `presentedTime`, `presentedClockDriven` (the HUD
  shows the presented frame against the clock).
- `AutomaticAudioOutput` listens for the default output device (CoreAudio); a device appearing
  makes a retry due at once. Tests can pass `watchDefaultDevice = false` and call
  `defaultOutputDeviceDidChange()`.

## Swift and app rules
- `VEEngine` and `VEPreviewView` are `NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR` (@MainActor in Swift); release the last
  reference on the main thread. `ProjectStore.init()` is a convenience init (default arguments
  are evaluated outside the main actor).
- `KeyboardController` takes keys only from `ProjectStore.editorWindow` (set by `ContentView`);
  new windows (export sheet, preferences) keep their own keys. Clicks in editor panels call
  `store.reclaimKeyboardFocus()`; new panels with text fields should do the same on their
  background taps.
- UI caches (`ThumbnailCache`, `WaveformCache`) have generations and ignore completions of a
  closed project; `VEEngineErrorProjectClosed` is not a failure. Both take an injectable `now`.
- The playhead can be dragged in the track area (empty space within 4 pt of it, or Option-drag).
  Bare =/+ and - zoom like Cmd+=/-.

## Build and signing
- Warnings are errors (`WARNING_CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra`, `GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`,
  `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`). Aggregates without default member initializers need every
  field (`-Wmissing-field-initializers`); give new struct fields defaults.
- Configurations: Debug and Release are ad hoc without the hardened runtime (launch headless);
  Distribution (the Archive action) has the hardened runtime and the identity/team from
  `Config/Distribution.xcconfig` (`FRAMEWRIGHT_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY`, `FRAMEWRIGHT_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`,
  optional gitignored `Config/Signing.local.xcconfig`). Anything new embedded in the app must
  be signed on copy (CodeSignOnCopy) or library validation rejects it under Distribution.
- `App/Resources/Acknowledgements.md` and `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` ship in the app; update the notice
  when a dependency or its version changes (and `ThirdParty/VERSIONS.md`).

## ExportJob (phase 7) notes carried over
- Create the compositor with `Compositor::create(device, {MTLPixelFormatRGBA16Float})`; `renderAndWait` into a pooled
  420v/BGRA `PixelBufferTarget`; `RenderResult` has `prescaledPlanes`, `gpuStartTime`, `gpuEndTime`, `skippedLayers`;
  call `releaseScratchMemory()` under memory pressure. Use `IMediaWriter::runPull` (pull mode) rather than push mode;
  `endStream(TrackKind)` when one stream ends early. Hardware encoders are size-dependent (H.264 hw not used at 8192x4320);
  the writer reports which it used.

## Phase 6 (effects, transitions, inspector) additions
- Facade: `beginCoalescingWithKey:mode:` (VECoalescingModeAccumulate for keyboard nudge bursts:
  each edit applies on top of the last and merges into one step; only SequenceCommands merge,
  so a CompositeCommand, e.g. a multi-clip speed change, is a step of its own even inside an
  Accumulate group) and `coalescingKey` (end only your own group: check it before
  `endCoalescing`). `ProjectStore.nudgeGroup` marks an open nudge burst, which
  `isGestureActive` does not count as a gesture (the next command commits it first).
- `VEClipParamsBatch` + `applyClipParams:` set several clips' parameters in one step (video
  parameters only on video tracks, audio only on audio tracks; refused as a whole).
- `transitionLimitFromClip:toClip:` / `transitionLimitForTransition:` (VETransitionLimit): the
  longest centred transition a cut takes and a user-facing reason; transition add/resize
  refusals now carry that reason and the longest allowed duration.
  `addTransitionFromClip:toClip:duration:options:` fits to the cut and/or adds the linked
  partners' transition in the same undo step.
- `setSpeedNumerator:denominator:forClips:ripple:scope:`: several clips, explicit ripple choice.
- App preferences (Settings > Editing, `EditingPreferences`): default transition duration,
  linked crossfade (always/never/ask), duration display (timecode/frames/seconds; also what
  `DurationFormat.parseFrames` assumes for a bare number). Export (phase 7) should show
  durations through `ProjectStore.durationString` for consistency.
- In-app drag types: `com.justjohn12345.framewright.transition.cross-dissolve` and
  `...audio-crossfade` (declared in project.yml / Info.plist, like the asset reference). The
  timeline's drops go through `TimelineDropDelegate` (assets and transitions).

## Phase 6 review fix round (`2026-09-23-phase6-review.md`)
- Linked transitions: with `FitToCut | IncludeLinked` each transition is fitted to its own cut
  (the dissolve and the crossfade can differ in length); the note names each shortening
  ("Shortened to …" for the requested one, "The linked clips' transition was shortened to …").
  `ProjectStore.addTransition` always passes IncludeLinked for "Always" (and for "Ask" when there
  is nothing to ask) and shows the engine's note, e.g. why the audio got no crossfade.
- Paused/stepping/scrubbing monitors (`PlaybackController::frameSource`): a frame whose pictures
  are still being decoded is held back ("unchanged") while the display's scrub request is in
  flight, so the previous complete picture stays up; the first frame after `setSequence`, or a
  frame whose request failed, is presented with what is available. `PresentedFrame` has
  `heldBackFrameIndex`; test harnesses that wait for "exact" must also wait for it to be -1.
  `VEPreviewView.missingLayerCount` is now set when a render takes a frame (it always describes
  the frame `-snapshot` composites). `ProgramFrameProvider` (source monitor scrubbing) already
  published only complete frames.
- Editing preferences are observable: `ProjectStore.preferences` (`EditingPreferencesModel`,
  mirrors of the three keys, re-read on `UserDefaults.didChangeNotification`; `revision` is a
  redraw token) and its changes are forwarded to the store's `objectWillChange`. Read
  `store.editingPreferences` (a snapshot) and format with `durationString` /
  `shortDurationString`; a model object that shows durations outside a view observing the store
  (like `SpeedDurationModel`) forwards `store.preferences.objectWillChange` itself. The export
  sheet (phase 7) gets this for free if it observes the store.
- The inspector sets the status line only for a note or a refusal (a plain success leaves it).
- `VEClipParamsBatch` is `NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR` and asserts the main thread.
- Removing a transition goes through `ProjectStore.removeTransition(_:)` (focus independent).

## Phase 7 (export) additions
- Engine: `Engine/Export/ExportJob.{h,mm}` (one export: validate, then a private DecodePool on the
  shared FrameCache with its own 0.25 budget share and lanes = clip ids, a Compositor created for
  RGBA16Float, an `OfflineAudioRenderer`, a writer from `BackendRouter::makeWriter`, all driven by
  `IMediaWriter::runPull`). Pictures are looked up with `playback::frameSlotFor` (shared with the
  program monitor), so an export shows exactly what the monitor shows. A layer that cannot be
  decoded fails the export ("Frame N (t s) cannot be exported: “name” could not be decoded ...");
  it is never drawn black or stale. Cancel completes in about 70 ms (measured), deleting the file.
- Audio: `Engine/Audio/OfflineAudioRenderer.{h,mm}` is the render thread of a private AudioMixer
  (same plans, envelopes, crossfade law, speed resampling and clipping as playback); it waits with
  `AudioMixer::isRangeReady` before each block, turns a failed source into an error
  (`failedSourceIn`) and treats any underrun as an error. Keyframed Motion (open finding 8) must be
  evaluated in the Scheduler / RenderGraph so export and playback keep sharing one path.
- Media: `VideoCodec::AV1` (FFmpeg writer only: libsvtav1 preset 8, CRF from quality, VBR from a bit
  rate; 8-bit input to yuv420p, 10-bit to yuv420p10le) and `ContainerFormat::MKV` (FFmpeg only);
  `BackendRouter::writerBackendFor/makeWriter` ("apple" first); `IMediaWriter::videoEncoderName()`;
  `HardwareCaps::encoderAvailability(codec, w, h, tenBit)` (VideoToolbox asked at the frame size,
  cached). AppleWriter encodes HEVC Main10 from 'x420' input; the compositor renders 'x420'/'xf20'
  targets (whole 10-bit codes). ProRes is fed 32BGRA (8-bit): a 10-bit 4:2:2 target ('x422' or
  'v210') is a phase 8 candidate for 10-bit sources.
- Fixed on the FFmpeg writer path: `ComposedMediaWriter::runPull` now ends (flushes) a stream as
  soon as its callback reports the end (the muxer no longer holds the other stream back), and
  `FFAudioEncoder` trims the silence that padded the last AAC frame (aac_at has no small last
  frame): packets are shortened/dropped at the real end, which ends the MP4 edit list exactly and
  becomes Matroska DiscardPadding (`EncodedPacket::trailingDiscard`). Before, an FFmpeg-written
  file's audio ran up to 1023 samples long.
- `DecodePool::waitForProgress(timeout)` (block until a step finished, instead of polling) and
  `refresh()` (restep settled streams: re-decodes a target frame evicted by memory pressure,
  retries a failed decode).
- Progress `bytesWritten` is the output file's size; AVAssetWriter stages MP4 (index up front)
  elsewhere, so it stays 0 for Apple MP4 until the end (MOV and FFmpeg files grow as they go).
- Facade: `VEExport.h` (VEExportPreset/Container/Resolution/RateControl/AudioCodec with explicit
  Swift names, `VEExportSettings` value object with `validationMessage` and
  `outputSizeForSequenceWidth:height:`, `VEExportFormat`, `VEExportProgress`, `VEExportSummary`,
  `VEExportHandle` with `cancel` / `cancelAndWaitWithTimeout:`); on VEEngine
  `exportFormatsForWidth:height:[completion:]`, `exportSizeForSettings:`,
  `estimatedFileSizeForSettings:` (bit rate, or a bits-per-pixel heuristic for quality mode: an
  estimate, labelled "≈" in the UI), `beginExportWithSettings:outputURL:progress:completion:error:`,
  `activeExport`, `isExporting`, `VEEngineExportDidProgressNotification` /
  `VEEngineExportDidFinishNotification`, error codes 6-11. New/Open cancels a running export (its
  asset ids are about to name other media); memory pressure is forwarded to the job.
- App: `App/Views/Export/ExportSheet.swift` (`ExportModel` + `ExportSheet`, `ExportFolderMemory`,
  `ProgressThrottle`); File > Export… (Cmd+E) via `ProjectStore.showExportSheet()`; the store
  republishes `isExporting` (also on `VEEngineExportDidFinish`); `DocumentController`
  `confirmStoppingExport(because:)` runs before New, Open, window close and quit (Stop Export
  cancels and waits up to 2 s for the file to be removed). The sheet stays up (modal on the editor
  window) while exporting; Close is disabled and Escape cancels the export.
- For the pending UX round (open findings 4-7): the sheet is 480 pt wide and self-contained; a
  pop-out program monitor (finding 7) must be paused by `beginExport...` like the two monitors are
  now (`_playback->pause()`, `_sourcePlayback->pause()`). WebM is not offered: the LGPL build's only
  Opus/Vorbis encoders are FFmpeg's experimental ones (AV1 goes to MP4 or MKV with AAC).
