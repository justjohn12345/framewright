# Open findings

Only what is still open. Fixed findings are in the history table of `README.md` (fix commits and regression tests);
the full reports are in git history at the commits the table names.

## Design items (effect lanes review, 2026-09-24; report in git history at fea82c0)
- D1, compact rows as in Resolve: a "Compact Tracks" toggle (View menu, timeline corner) and per-track compact rows
  when lanes are collapsed: about 22 pt video / 20 pt audio with the clip name only, a 3 pt strip at the clip's
  bottom marking spans and transitions in their kind colours (click expands the lanes), a one-line header (name,
  eye/mute, lock; solo and target in the context menu). Files: `TimelineViewModel` (a `Track.compact` flag, row
  heights, `lanes()` empty when compact), `TimelineRenderer` (compact clip + marker strip), `TrackHeaderView`,
  `WindowLayout` (persist next to `collapsedLaneTracks`), `ProjectStore` (cache key), `TimelineGestureController`
  (trim zones on 20 pt rows; no span hits when collapsed), redraw and lane tests.
- D3, restore the window frame, clamped to the displays present: nothing persists the frame today (SwiftUI `Window`,
  `FramewrightApp.swift`, no autosave). Save the frame and its screen's frame under a `WindowLayoutModel` key on
  resize/move (debounced, through `WindowAccessor.CloseGuard`) and on close. Restore once on first attach: the screen
  containing the saved centre, else main; width/height = min(saved, visible), not below 1100×640 unless the display
  is smaller; shift inside the visible frame; `setFrame`. Re-clamp on `didChangeScreenParametersNotification`. Set
  `isRestorable = false` so SwiftUI restoration does not fight it. A pure
  `restoredFrame(saved:savedScreen:screens:minimum:)` unit-tested for external-monitor → laptop.

## Post-lanes review (2026-09-29; report in git history at f486a6a)
All findings (M1, M2, L1-L9) and test gaps 1-6 and 10 were fixed in 47b1a45..eb4d3d5 and verified by the lead (see the
README history table). Still open:
- Test gap 7, the throughput of a reversed long-GOP 4K clip in playback and export (each backward window decodes
  forward from its keyframe; unmeasured, the test media has no 4K long-GOP source).
- Test gap 8, the Ken Burns mode switch's own timeline builds and canvas draws, and Continue on Next Clip from Ken
  Burns mode.
- Test gap 9, the export parity tolerance, kept on purpose (the wipe edge is held by `TransitionShapeTests`).
- Found in the fix round: J (-1x) from a pause on a forward clip presents 2 to 5 late first frames in the playback
  harness (the stopped lookahead decodes toward forward play only); a reversed clip at J is exact.
- Known limit: an insert or overwrite in the middle of a clip divides its Motion spans too; their right parts open
  in the automatic Ken Burns mode (only a split passes the chosen mode on, L6).

## Facade class extraction review (2026-09-30; commits be13a90..6435e24)
- An export's security-scoped output URL stays accessed when its exporter goes away first (predates the extraction:
  the engine's dealloc behaved the same). `-[VEExporter dealloc]` (and `-[VEEngine dealloc]` through `cancel`)
  cancels the running job, but the job's completion then finds no exporter (`VEExporter.mm`, the `onCompletion`
  lambda in `beginExportOfProject:...`), so `stopAccessingOutputURL` never runs and the
  `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` balance leaks for the process's life. It cannot simply stop in `dealloc`:
  the cancelled job still deletes its partial file on its own queue and needs the access until it ends. Fix: let the
  completion lambda own the accessed URL (capture it and stop there whether or not the exporter is alive), and test
  it with `testReleasingTheExporterCancelsItsExport` extended to count the accesses.

## Known limits, with reasons
- The render goldens cannot be re-recorded (their tool needed the schema-4 engine); new migration cases are checked
  against version 4's rule computed independently instead.
- The Ken Burns editor's mode per span (Ken Burns or Transform) is remembered for the session of the project only:
  the only persisted UI state is the app-wide window layout, span ids restart per project, and a project-side store
  would be a schema change (out of scope for the Ken Burns and Transform round). A reopened project opens every span
  in the automatic mode.
- `VEEditErrorNotRepresentable` from the span calls needs a 128-bit overflow of a clip's source time: no facade input
  reaches it, so its message is covered by reading only.
- What the real Photos drag hands over (one listed type per file for a Live Photo? a rename or an overwrite when two
  promised files share a name in the staging folder?) is not observable in the test host; the double of the
  receiver's contract covers both counts, errors and collisions.

## Test gaps that need a UI-test target (XCUITest) or a person
The xctest host is not sandboxed and its synthesised NSEvents never reach SwiftUI's gesture system or the window
server's drag session, so these are covered at the model level only:
- Real SwiftUI gesture path: `TimelineGestureTests.testARealDragThroughSwiftUIIsCommittedAndNotReverted` drives the
  hosted TimelineView through `NSWindow.sendEvent` and skips with that reason. The same applies to the timeline's lane
  drags (ranges, spans, transition edges), the Ken Burns overlay's box and rectangle drags and its mode switch, and the
  Effects-tab drags onto a cut or a lane; the controllers and models behind them are tested with synthetic points.
- Sandbox-hosted export round trip (phase 7 gap 7): choose a file in the real save panel, switch the container, export.
  The model side (a container change clears the choice and asks again) is tested in `ExportModelTests`.
- A real-sandbox save/open round trip, and a main-window smoke test that triggers the thumbnail/waveform fetches it
  asserts.
- The program output on a physical second display: window, engine attachment, Escape, screen removal, key scoping and
  hide/reshow on deactivate are tested over an injected screen list and posted notifications (`OutputDisplayTests`);
  that the picture reaches the display, covers it, follows a hot-unplug and a real Cmd-Tab needs a person.
- The timeline's right-click menu (Set Interpolation, Move to Lane) is built and tested as items; the NSMenu pop-up from
  a real right-click is by hand.
- Photos drops: a real drag from Photos.app (the window server's promise session and `NSFilePromiseReceiver` reading
  the drag pasteboard), an iCloud original downloading during a drop, the PHPicker sheet itself, the folder panel in
  the real sandbox, and a security-scoped Media folder bookmark going stale (a plain bookmark's rewrite is tested).
- `VEEnginePlaybackTests.testPlayStartLatencyThroughTheFacade` on AirPods or another Bluetooth output: it skips and
  its message and log line give the measured latency (the decision is read from CoreAudio at run time).
- The divider between the source and program monitors while the source plays: the AppKit handle's drag is tested
  through `NSWindow.sendEvent` during playback, and the user confirmed the grab by hand on 2026-09-25; the original
  SwiftUI failure was never reproduced in the test host.

## Stress test observations (StressTests scheme, 2026-09-29; numbers in the test logs, Debug build)
- The timeline's minimum zoom is 2 pt/s (`TimelineViewModel.minPixelsPerSecond`), so Zoom to Fit cannot show a
  two-hour sequence: it needs 14,400 pt (`TwoHourProjectStressTests` pages through it in 11 widths of 1429 pt). A
  minimum derived from the sequence's length would let a long project fit the window.
- Footprint not explained by the frame cache: on the two-hour project the thumbnail and waveform pass adds about 230 MB
  (198 thumbnails fetched; the frame cache stays at 48 MB), and the edits and a reopen add 24 to 149 MB each, varying
  between runs, while the frame cache is full (512 MB, of which the footprint shows far less) or, after the reopen,
  nearly empty (3 MB). Everything stays under the test's bound (growth after the build under the frame cache budget
  plus 131 MB: measured +283 to +375 MB after the edits); an Instruments allocation pass over the thumbnail service
  and the reopen would say whether anything is kept that should not be.
- A cold play start (caches purged, a jump, play at once) measured 34 to 60 ms; the one at 1:40:00 was 51 to 60 ms in
  every run. The product's 50 ms target is for a cached start (`testPlayStartLatencyThroughTheFacade`); a cold start
  has no target yet.

## Test gaps that need media or a performance scheme (phase 7)
- Gap 8, size estimate against a real export in quality mode: the estimate is a bits-per-pixel heuristic (labelled "≈");
  the synthetic burn-in media compresses far better than camera footage, so a tolerance tight enough to mean something
  would only hold for that media. Needs a set of representative camera clips (not in the repository) to calibrate.
- Gap 9, long-export memory: now in the opt-in `StressTests` scheme (README, "Stress tests").
  `HourExportStressTests` exports 107,892 frames (one hour at 29.97 fps) three times, sampling the footprint at every
  progress delivery (about 700 samples): the trend stays within 0.25 KB per frame and the peak within 96 MB of the first
  warm sample (measured over four runs: +0.1 to +31.2 MB, trend -0.32 to +0.01 KB per frame). It renders at 640x360, so the hour takes
  about 80 s; a 4K soak would need 4K source media, which the generator does not make, and is still not covered (the
  per-frame buffers scale with the size, the flatness over time is what the hour shows).
- Not deterministic to unit-test: AVAssetWriter's cancel in the middle of `finishWritingWithCompletionHandler`
  (`cancelWriting` while the MP4 index rewrite runs). The early check and the FFmpeg writer's per-packet check are tested
  (`testFinishIsCancellableOnBothWriters`, `testCancelWhileFinishingKeepsTheExistingFile`); the 20 ms polling loop
  around the completion is exercised only when finishing takes longer than one slice.
